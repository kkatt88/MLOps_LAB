We simulated a real-world workflow involving two roles: the developer and the gatekeeper.

We practiced doing the push and pull of code.

The developer added files to the repo and the gatekeeper reviewed the changes.

The gatekeeper confirms the merge.

We learned the process of making changes, as the gatekeeper after review found that the requirements.txt files was missing. The necessary changes where made and the push/pull request process was renewed.

This exercise gave us practical experience with:

Branching and merging in Git

Code review workflows

Identifying and correcting common oversights ======= The developer forked an empty repository, add the project files to the repository, commited the changes and created a pull request. The gate keeper reviewed the pull request and didn't merge due to the absence of the requirements.txt file. Another commit was made, adding the missing file, followed by a pull request that was aproved and merge by the gatekeeper.
